# HNG14 Stage 2 DevOps - Containerized Microservices Application

## Overview

This project takes a broken multi-service application and fixes it, containerizes it with Docker, and ships it with a full 6-stage CI/CD pipeline on GitHub Actions. The stack consists of a Node.js frontend, a FastAPI backend, a Python worker, and Redis as a job queue.

## Architecture
[User] → [Frontend :3000] → [API :8000] → [Redis]
↑
[Worker]

- **Frontend** - Node.js/Express app on port 3000. Accepts job submissions and proxies status checks to the API.
- **API** - FastAPI/Python app on port 8000. Creates jobs, stores them in Redis, returns status.
- **Worker** - Python process. Listens on Redis queue, processes jobs, updates status.
- **Redis** - In-memory job queue and state store. Internal only — not exposed to the host.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Git** - to clone the repository
- **Docker** >= 24.0 - to build and run containers
- **Docker Compose** >= 2.0 (v2, included with Docker Desktop)
- **curl** - to test endpoints (optional but recommended)

To verify your installations:

```bash
git --version
docker --version
docker compose version
```

---

## How to Bring the Stack Up on a Clean Machine

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/officialsangdavid/hng14-stage2-devops.git
cd hng14-stage2-devops
```

### Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

The default values in `.env.example` work out of the box for local development. No changes needed.

### Step 3: Build and Start All Services

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

This command will:
- Build Docker images for the frontend, API, and worker
- Pull the official Redis image from Docker Hub
- Start all 4 containers in detached mode
- Run health checks on each service before marking them ready

### Step 4: Wait for Services to Be Healthy

Wait approximately 30 seconds, then run:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

### What a Successful Startup Looks Like
NAME                             IMAGE                          STATUS
hng14-stage2-devops-api-1        hng14-stage2-devops-api        Up (healthy)
hng14-stage2-devops-frontend-1   hng14-stage2-devops-frontend   Up (healthy)
hng14-stage2-devops-redis-1      redis:7-alpine                 Up (healthy)
hng14-stage2-devops-worker-1     hng14-stage2-devops-worker     Up

All services should show `Up` and the API, frontend, and Redis should show `(healthy)`.

---

## Verifying the Application Works

### Check Health Endpoints

```bash
# Frontend health
curl http://localhost:3000/health
# Expected: {"status":"healthy"}

# API health
curl http://localhost:8000/health
# Expected: {"status":"healthy"}
```

### Submit a Job

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/submit
# Expected: {"job_id":"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"}
```

### Check Job Status

```bash
# Replace JOB_ID with the job_id from the previous response
curl http://localhost:3000/status/JOB_ID
# Expected: {"job_id":"...","status":"completed"}
```

The status will transition from `queued` → `processing` → `completed` within a few seconds.

### Check Logs

```bash
# View all logs
docker compose logs

# View logs for a specific service
docker compose logs api
docker compose logs worker
docker compose logs frontend
```

---

## Bugs Fixed

All bugs found and fixed are documented in detail in [FIXES.md](./FIXES.md).

Summary of issues found in the original source code:

- Redis connection hardcoded to `localhost` in both API and Worker
- API URL hardcoded to `localhost` in Frontend
- Missing `/health` endpoints in API and Frontend
- Frontend not binding to `0.0.0.0`
- Unpinned dependency versions in `requirements.txt`
- Missing error handling in Worker job processing
- Unused `signal` import in Worker with no graceful shutdown
- Missing `.dockerignore` files
- No test suite

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

The GitHub Actions pipeline at `.github/workflows/pipeline.yml` runs automatically on every push to `main` or `develop` and on pull requests to `main`.

### Pipeline Stages

**Stage 1 - Lint**
- Runs `flake8` on all Python code (API and Worker)
- Runs `eslint` on JavaScript (Frontend)
- Runs `hadolint` on all three Dockerfiles

**Stage 2 - Test**
- Spins up a Redis service container
- Installs Python dependencies
- Runs `pytest` with coverage report
- Uploads coverage report as artifact

**Stage 3 - Security Scan**
- Builds all three Docker images
- Runs Trivy vulnerability scanner on each image
- Reports CRITICAL severity findings

**Stage 4 - Build**
- Builds all three Docker images tagged with the git SHA and `latest`
- Verifies images exist

**Stage 5 - Integration Test**
- Starts the full stack with `docker compose up`
- Waits up to 60 seconds for all services to be healthy
- Tests health endpoints
- Submits a real job and polls until it reaches `completed` status
- Tears down the stack

**Stage 6 - Deploy** (main branch only)
- Builds updated images
- Runs rolling update via `deploy.sh`
- Updates API, frontend, and worker one at a time
- Each service must be healthy before moving to the next
- Aborts and exits with error if any service fails health check within 60 seconds
- Verifies frontend is healthy after full deployment

## Tearing Down

```bash
# Stop and remove all containers, networks, and volumes
docker compose down -v

# Also remove built images (full cleanup)
docker compose down -v --rmi all
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `REDIS_HOST` | `redis` | Redis service hostname (Docker service name) |
| `REDIS_PORT` | `6379` | Redis port |
| `API_URL` | `http://api:8000` | Internal API URL for frontend proxy |
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` | Node.js environment |

---

## Notes

- Redis is never exposed to the host machine — it is only accessible within the Docker network
- All services run as non-root users inside their containers
- Multi-stage Docker builds are used for API and Frontend to minimize image size
- The Worker has no HTTP health endpoint — it is monitored by checking if the process is running

## Bugs Fixed

All bugs found and fixed are documented in detail in [FIXES.md](./FIXES.md).

Summary of issues found in the original source code:

- Redis connection hardcoded to `localhost` in both API and Worker — must use Docker service name `redis`
- API URL hardcoded to `localhost` in Frontend — must use environment variable
- Missing `/health` endpoints in API and Frontend — required for Docker health checks
- Frontend not binding to `0.0.0.0` — was only accessible from inside the container
- Unpinned dependency versions in `requirements.txt` — caused non-reproducible builds
- Missing error handling in Worker job processing — jobs would be lost on exceptions
- Unused `signal` import in Worker with no graceful shutdown implementation
- Missing `.dockerignore` files — caused bloated images and potential secret leakage
- No test suite — pipeline requires pytest tests to run

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

The GitHub Actions pipeline at `.github/workflows/pipeline.yml` runs automatically on every push to `main` or `develop` and on pull requests to `main`.

### Pipeline Stages

**Stage 1 - Lint**
- Runs `flake8` on all Python code in API and Worker
- Runs `eslint` on JavaScript in Frontend
- Runs `hadolint` on all three Dockerfiles to catch bad practices

**Stage 2 - Test**
- Spins up a Redis service container
- Installs all Python dependencies
- Runs `pytest` with coverage reporting
- Uploads HTML coverage report as a downloadable artifact

**Stage 3 - Security Scan**
- Builds all three Docker images
- Runs Trivy vulnerability scanner on each image
- Reports CRITICAL severity findings

**Stage 4 - Build**
- Builds all three Docker images tagged with the git SHA and `latest`
- Verifies images were built successfully

**Stage 5 - Integration Test**
- Starts the full stack with `docker compose up --build`
- Waits up to 60 seconds for all services to be healthy
- Tests both health endpoints
- Submits a real job and polls until it reaches `completed` status
- Tears down the full stack after testing

**Stage 6 - Deploy** (runs on `main` branch only)
- Builds updated images
- Runs rolling update via `deploy.sh`
- Updates API, frontend, and worker one at a time
- Each service must pass health check before the next one is updated
- Aborts with exit code 1 if any service fails health check within 60 seconds
- Verifies frontend is healthy after full deployment completes

| `REDIS_PORT` | `6379` | Redis port |
| `API_URL` | `http://api:8000` | Internal API URL used by the frontend proxy |
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` | Node.js environment |

## Notes

- Redis is never exposed to the host machine — it is only reachable within the internal Docker network
- All services run as non-root users inside their containers for security
- Multi-stage Docker builds are used for the API and Frontend to minimize final image size
- The Worker has no HTTP endpoint — it is monitored by checking if the process is running
- Secrets and `.env` files are never committed — use `.env.example` as a template
